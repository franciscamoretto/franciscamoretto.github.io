			<div class="aboutContent">
				<div>I am Senior QA Engineer currently living in Toronto with an open work permit looking for new opportunities. I have a wonderful and super fluffy dog named Luna.</div>

				<div>
					For more than 13 years, I've been helping companies to deliver awesome software products.
					I've worked for medium and large companies in Brazil (with international clients), helping them to roll out into production, improve performance, stabilize releases, streamline processes, hunt down bugs, just to name a few.</div>
				<div>
					Striving for a quality product has made me a professional that seeks all the time to satisfy the customer, that's why I'm always ready to help them by explaining a complex concept, perform product demos, and more.
					I'm result driven and I push the development team to put quality in every aspect of their work. </div>
				<div>
					I'm also interested in Test Automation which I have been studying and looking to learn all I can and actively use in my day-to-day and also team leadership which I believe is the next step in my career.</div>
